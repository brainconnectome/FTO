1. Testing newest eddy_cuda (cuda runtime 7.5 installed on c2b2) with --repol and --s2vr options

-eddy_cuda took ~1hr per image (28 dirs)

-before and after eddy_cuda

-note that *CERTAIN* GPU cards in c2b2 have outdated drivers that are *NOT* compatible with either cuda runtime version of 7.5, 8.0.
